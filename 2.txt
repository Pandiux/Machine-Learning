STEREOTYPE THREAT

As the workforce ages, and people retire later in life, organizations will need to develop
strategies to engage their mature-age workers. We used a stereotype threat framework to
investigate the impact of threat-inducing (young manager, young workgroup, manual
occupation) and threat-inhibiting (high performance practices, mature-age practices)
contextual cues on mature-age worker engagement. A total of 666 mature-age employees
in Australia described their work experiences in three surveys administered over a three-
year period. Results indicated that mature-age employees who experienced stereotype
threat in the workplace reported lower engagement 11–12 months later. All of the con-
textual cues had an impact on stereotype threat and exerted indirect (mediated by ste-
reotype threat) effects on engagement. However, the effects of manager age were
moderated by organizational practices. Diversity conscious mature-age practices mod-
erated the indirect effect of manager age, so mature-age practices were particularly
beneficial in counteracting negative cues associated with young managers. But diversity
blind high performance practices moderated the direct effect of manager age, so high
performance practices were especially helpful in generating engagement among mature-
age workers with older managers. We recommend that organizations adopt both
diversity blind and diversity conscious practices into their diversity management
portfolios. The two types of practices are complementary and have additive effects on
mature-age worker engagement.
In response to these demographic pressures, some
countries are redefining “working age” by sys-
tematically raising the ages at which individuals
can access government- and employer-supported
retirement funds (Gov. UK, n.d.; Social Security
Administration, n.d.). Australia plans to incre-
mentally increase the official retirement age to
70 by 2035, making its retirement age the highest
in the world. These changes are likely to sig-
nificantly extend an employee’s working life
(Gruber & Wise, 2005) but they only address part
of the grand challenge associated with aging
populations. “Policy changes. . .may increase the
hiring and retention of older workers, but they
will not necessarily engage or motivate older
workers” (Kulik, Ryan, Harper & George, 2014:
932, italics added).
Engagement is “a positive, fulfilling, work-related
state of mind” (Schaufeli, Salanova, González-Romá
& Bakker, 2002: 74) characterized by vigor (high
energy and motivation) and dedication (strong
The United Nations, Department of Economic and
Social Affairs, Population Division (2015: 1) describes
the aging of the world’s population as “one of the most
significant social transformations of the twenty-first
century.” As older individuals constitute increasingly
large shares of the total population, the societal sys-
tems that rely on “working age” persons to support
retirees are increasingly strained. For example, in
1901, there were 15 people of working age to sup-
port every Australian over 65; today there are fewer
than five (Australian Institute of Superannuation
Trustees–Australian Centre for Financial Studies,
2014). In North America and most of Europe, support
ratios are similarly low and will continue to decline.

identification with the work role) (Bakker, Albrecht,
& Leiter, 2011; Mauno, Kinnunen, & Ruokolainen,
2007). Engaged employees are not just physically
present but “psychologically present – more atten-
tive, integrated and focused” (He, Zhu, & Zheng,
2014: 683). Employee engagement is an important
predictor of employee job performance (Christian,
Garza, & Slaughter, 2011; Ho, Wong, & Lee, 2011)
and so both practitioners and academics are eager to
identify the antecedents and facilitators of employee
engagement.
Historically, organizations have been most atten-
tive to employee engagement in the earliest stages of
employment (the honeymoon; Boswell, Boudreau, &
Tichy, 2005). In fact, the highest levels of engage-
ment may be experienced in the first six months of
employment (Gallup, 2013). But once the active so-
cialization period ends and the employee has settled
into his or her role, management attention wanes (the
hangover; Boswell et al., 2005). For younger em-
ployees, the hangover can be transformed back to
honeymoon with a promotion or job change. But
older employees at the top of their career lad-
ders have limited mobility (Gringart, Helmes, &
Speelman, 2013; Shacklock, Fulop, & Hort, 2007)
and face longer and longer hangovers. Fully engag-
ing mature-age workers over their extended working
lives will require employers to present a “different
and distinctive value proposition” (Cappelli &
Novelli, 2010: xix) that explicitly acknowledges
this demographic group’s unique challenges—
particularly the challenges generated by age stereo-
types. Age stereotypes are notoriously persistent
in organizations; mature-age employees are consis-
tently perceived to be less productive than their
younger counterparts (Posthuma & Campion, 2009).
They are also viewed as lacking initiative, disinter-
ested in learning or developing, and resistant to
change (Armstrong-Stassen & Schlosser, 2008;
Maurer, Barbeite, Weiss, & Lippstreu, 2008; Ng &
Feldman, 2012).
AGE STEREOTYPES IN CONTEXT
Employee age is a continuum, but societal efforts
to develop policy and enact legislation to manage an
aging population are establishing mature-age
workers as a defined “target category” with explicit
membership criteria (Desmette & Gaillard, 2008:
168). In Australia, where we conducted our research,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) adopted age
45 as the lower boundary defining “mature-age”
workers (ABS, 2004) and this definition diffused
2133
across Australian associations, government agencies,
and employment services (Australian Chamber
of Commerce and Industry, 2012; Australian
Law Reform Commission, 2012, 2013; National
Seniors Productive Ageing Center, 2012; https://au.
oneshiftjobs.com/adage/). Public forums and news-
paper articles regularly reference the ABS’s 451
definition in their discussion of age stereotypes:
“Employers regard workers as over the hill at 45,
Age Discrimination Commissioner Susan Ryan
said. . .People who are 45 should start thinking about
the future. . .After 45, it’s harder and harder to find
a job. . .” (Bita, 2014). Mature-age workers are warned
against confirming age stereotypes through their
own behavior: “. . .don’t fall into stereotypes of being
grumpy, bitter and inflexible” (Hoffman, 2005).
These societal-level communications simulta-
neously define 451 workers as a target group af-
fected by negative stereotypes, and indirectly (albeit
unintentionally) reinforce those stereotypes by re-
peating and transmitting their content (Jones &
Carpenter, 2014).
Stereotypes are socially shared and readily acti-
vated (they are “in the air”; Steele, 1997), but stereo-
type salience varies across situations and contexts.
Members of any stereotyped group—including
mature-age workers—actively monitor organiza-
tional contexts for cues indicating whether they are
likely to be evaluated in light of their group’s nega-
tive stereotype (Walton, Murphy, & Ryan, 2015).
Stereotype threat is a “fluid, situational threat”
(Lamont, Swift, & Abrams, 2015: 180) that is evoked
by subtle cues signaling that one’s identity group
may not be valued in the immediate environment
(e.g., being a numerical minority, reporting to
someone who is not a member of your identity
group, stereotypical objects in the physical décor;
Cheryan, Plaut, Davies, & Steele, 2009; Schmader,
Johns, & Forbes, 2008). Stereotype threat disrupts
task performance and negatively impacts an in-
dividual’s motivation and engagement (Roberson &
Kulik, 2007; Shapiro & Neuberg, 2007).
But contextual cues can also reduce stereotype
threat: The context is “both the problem and the so-
lution” (Kulik, 2014a: 457). Some contextual cues
(e.g., practices that affirm one’s identity group) re-
assure an individual that his or her group is valued
and respected; these cues generate a sense of psy-
chological safety in the work environment (Davies,
Spencer, & Steele, 2005; Purdie-Vaughns, Steele,
Davies, Ditlmann, & Crosby, 2008). Researchers have
been urged to “focus on managerial practices that will
create a friendlier environment and atmosphere” for2134

mature-age workers (Posthuma & Campion, 2009:
177). However, the vast majority of work on stereo-
typing and prejudice has focused on individuals’ at-
titudes (Fiske, 2003) and identified a narrow portfolio
of strategies that emphasize changing managerial at-
titudes toward mature-age workers (e.g., through di-
versity training). Managerial attitudes, unfortunately,
are stubbornly resistant to change (Kulik & Roberson,
2008). A stereotype threat perspective that focuses on
contextual variations (e.g., organizational policies
and practices) could “effectively take the stereotype
off the table” (Walton et al., 2015: 525) and generate
greater engagement among mature-age workers.
Figure 1 presents our proposed model, positioning
stereotype threat as a central mediator in the re-
lationship between organizational contextual cues
and mature-age worker engagement. We investigate
the impact of both threat-inducing and threat-
inhibiting contextual cues, and consider the possi-
bility that threat-inhibiting cues might mitigate the
effects of some threat-inducing cues in the same
work environment.
STEREOTYPE THREAT AND THE
MATURE-AGE WORKER
Stereotype threat generates a physiological stress
response and a monitoring process to detect signs of
performance failure (Schmader & Beilock, 2012). It
also activates coping mechanisms to manage the
negative cognitive and emotional by-products of
those processes (Inzlicht, Tullett, Legault, & Kang,
2011). In threat-inducing contexts, people try to push
negative thoughts about stereotypes out of their
minds and deny the negative feelings they are ex-
periencing (Inzlicht et al., 2011). But all of these
threat responses are resource-depleting (Kang &
Inzlicht, 2014) and divert essential cognitive and
motivational resources from the task at hand. In his
earliest theorizing about the effects of stereotype
threat, Steele (1997) suggested that acute experi-
ences with stereotype threat would generate tangible
short-term performance deficits. But he also sug-
gested that the chronic experience of stereotype
threat would eventually lead to psychological dis-
engagement from the performance domain.
The performance decrements associated with
acute stereotype threat have been well-documented
for a wide range of demographic groups across a va-
riety of performance domains (see Kalokerinos, von
Hippel, & Zacher, 2014; Spencer, Logel, & Davies,
2015; Walton et al., 2015 for recent reviews).
Stereotype threat is typically manipulated in the
laboratory by reminding participants about the
underperformance of a particular identity group
(e.g., Spencer, Steele, & Quinn, 1999) or by remind-
ing participants of their membership in a stereotyped
group before taking a difficult test (e.g., Steele &

Kulik, Perera, and Cregan
Aronson, 1995). For example, one of the most central
elements in older adult stereotypes involves mem-
ory; adults of all ages believe that memory declines
during adulthood (Hertzog, Lineweaver, & McGuire,
1999). When acute stereotype threat is induced in
older adults (by exposing them to scrambled sen-
tences containing age-stereotypic words, asking
them to read news articles about the relationship
between memory and aging, or emphasizing that the
task is a memory test), they perform less well on tasks
that involve memory (Hess & Hinson, 2006).
The disengagement consequences of chronic ex-
posure to stereotype threat have received signifi-
cantly less attention despite their clear application
to organizational settings (Block, Koch, Liberman,
Merriweather, & Roberson, 2011; Kalokerinos et al.,
2014). In some organizational contexts, mature-age
employees are “constantly bombarded with cues to
age stereotyping” (Lamont et al., 2015: 189); they
“experience stereotype threat from the moment they
walk in the office door each morning until they leave
at the end of the day” (Kalokerinos et al., 2014: 384).
The cognitive effort required to perform in an envi-
ronment that chronically generates stereotype threat
is taxing and fatiguing (Kang & Inzlicht, 2014). People
who experience stereotype threat report less interest
in the task (Smith, Sansone, & White, 2007) and as-
sess their task experience more negatively (Adams,
Garcia, Purdie-Vaughns, & Steele, 2006). But they
also lose confidence in their own abilities (Koch,
Müller, & Sieverding, 2008). The combination of de-
creased enjoyment and diminished self-confidence
leads threatened individuals to “disidentify” with
achievement in the performance domain (Steele &
Aronson, 1995; Steele, Spencer, & Aronson, 2002).
Disidentification may be expressed through negative
attitudes (e.g., expressing disinterest, dissatisfaction,
or even disdain for the performance domain; Shapiro
& Neuberg, 2007). For example, mature-age workers
who experience more stereotype threat report more
job dissatisfaction (von Hippel, Kalokerinos, &
Henry, 2013). Disidentification is also likely to be
expressed through a lack of engagement in one’s
work. Psychological disengagement allows an indi-
vidual to persist in the domain that generates ste-
reotype threat without doing further damage to his or
her self-worth (Nussbaum & Steele, 2007; Woodcock,
Hernandez, Estrada, & Schultz, 2012).
Threat-inducing Cues
Stereotype threat can be induced by multiple
contextual cues, but the literature is dominated by
2135
empirical investigations that focus on a single
experimentally-manipulated cue. It is important to
study multiple sources of stereotype threat, because
“knowing what source of threat has the strongest
effect on people may enable researchers and orga-
nizations to better target stereotype threat in-
terventions” (Xavier, Fritzsche, Sanz, & Smith, 2014:
443). In this research, we investigate the threat-
inducing effects of: (1) the age of the mature-age
employee’s manager, (2) the age composition of the
mature-age employee’s workgroup, and (3) the
mature-age employee’s occupation. These three
variables sensitize an employee to the possibility
that his or her experience in the work environment
might be contingent on his or her identity as a ma-
ture-age worker (Purdie-Vaughns et al., 2008).
Young managers. As the workforce ages, and
organizations reinvent themselves through mergers
and restructurings, mature-age workers are in-
creasingly likely to be supervised by young managers
(Collins, Hair, & Rocco, 2009; Shore, Cleveland, &
Goldberg, 2003). But if powerful people in the local
environment are not members of your own stereo-
typed identity group, “it tells you something”
(Steele, 2010: 141). Overall, mature-age employees
generally prefer older supervisors (Tonks,
Dickenson, & Nelson, 2009); they believe that older
supervisors are fairer than younger ones (Armstrong-
Stassen & Lee, 2009) and provide greater support
(Tsui, Xin, & Egan, 1996). Mature-age workers are
also likely to anticipate more stereotyping from
a young manager than an old one, because mature-
age people believe that young people view them as
“boring, old, stubborn and grumpy” while over-
looking attributes like “responsible, mature, and
hard working” that young people actually report
when asked to describe older people (Finkelstein,
Ryan, & King, 2013: 652).
Young workgroups. The number of peers who are
members of one’s own stereotyped group is a “criti-
cal mass” cue that can induce stereotype threat
(Steele, 2010: 140). When an employee is the only
member with the stereotyped identity in the work
environment (or one of very few members with the
stereotyped identity), the employee is more likely to
expect to be evaluated on the basis of the stereotype
(Avery, McKay, & Wilson, 2007; Cohen & Swim,
1995; Niemann & Dovidio, 1998). Mature-age em-
ployees in young workgroups might be particularly
likely to experience stereotype threat because people
use age to infer status (Lawrence, 1988); a mature-
age employee surrounded by young peers violates
status norms (Perry, Kulik, & Zhou, 1999). These2136
Academy of Management Journal
demographic violations of age grading (Lawrence,
1988) can lead to older worker concerns that they
will be perceived by their organizational colleagues
as plateaued and induce stereotype threat.
Manual occupations. Jobs and occupations may
be age-typed—viewed as more or less suitable for
workers of particular ages (Goldberg, Finkelstein,
Perry, & Konrad, 2004; Posthuma & Campion, 2009).
Manual laborers perform physical work that does not
develop or require cognitive skills. Jobs that involve
only manual labor are frequently age-typed as young
people’s jobs; people underestimate the extent to
which these jobs are successfully performed by older
people (Gordon & Arvey, 1986). Both employers
(Loretto & White, 2006) and employees (Duncan &
Loretto, 2004) believe that age-related performance
declines are more prevalent among manual la-
borers than among people in other occupations
(e.g., professional, clerical, sales, or craft occupa-
tions) and many managers view manual labor roles
as unsuitable for older workers (Jenkins & Poulston,
2014). Mature-age employees in manual labor oc-
cupations are likely to be aware of these negative age
stereotypes. They may be particularly concerned
about confirming those stereotypes, because manual
labor roles offer few opportunities to compensate for
age-related declines in fluid intelligence (novel
problem solving abilities) with crystallized intelli-
gence (accumulated knowledge and experiences)
(Salthouse, 2012).
Hypothesis 1. There will be a significant associ-
ation between contextual cues and stereotype
threat such that the highest levels of stereotype
threat will be experienced by mature-age em-
ployees (a) supervised by young managers, (b) in
workgroups dominated by young employees,
and/or (c) working in manual labor occupations.
Further, because chronic exposure to stereotype
threat initiates disidentification processes (Steele &
Aronson, 1995; Steele et al., 2002), we expect that
these threat-inducing contextual cues will have
a downstream effect on the mature-age worker’s en-
gagement. The contextual cues are ambiguous and
require interpretation, so they sap psychological re-
sources as the mature-age worker continuously as-
sesses and updates the likelihood of stereotyping in
his or her work environment (Steele, 2010: 141).
Hypothesis 2. There will be a significant indirect
effect of contextual cues on engagement (via
stereotype threat) such that the lowest levels of
engagement will be reported by mature-age
December
employees (a) supervised by young managers, (b)
in workgroups dominated by young employees,
and/or (c) working in manual labor occupations.
Threat-inhibiting Cues
The practices that organizations adopt are “com-
munications from employer to employee” (Bowen &
Ostroff, 2004: 207). These practices must be per-
ceived and interpreted by employees in order to
have an effect (Nishii, Lepak, & Schneider, 2008;
Takeuchi, Chen, & Lepak, 2009). Employees are
motivated to demonstrate positive attitudes and be-
haviors when they perceive that their employer
values them and their contribution (Cropanzano,
Rupp, & Byrne, 2003; Takeuchi et al., 2009). The
most effective signals are delivered by “bundles”
(MacDuffie, 1995) of interrelated practices that con-
sistently convey the organization’s values (Bowen &
Ostroff, 2004; Ostroff & Bowen, 2016).
Stereotype threat can simultaneously target an
individual’s personal identity (am I personally val-
ued in this context?) and the individual’s social
identity (are people like me valued in this context?)
(Derks, van Laar, & Ellemers, 2007; Shapiro &
Neuberg, 2007; Shapiro, Williams, & Hambarchyan,
2013). The negative effects of stereotype threat can
therefore be countered by affirming an individual’s
personal identity, social identity, or both. We ex-
amine two distinct “bundles” of discretionary or-
ganizational practices that may send affirming
messages to mature-age employees: high perfor-
mance practices and mature-age practices. Discre-
tionary organizational practices demonstrate respect
for an employee’s rights beyond those required by
law (Koys, 1988); these practices communicate that
the organization cares for the employee’s well-being
(Nishii et al., 2008).
High performance work systems are designed to
enhance employees’ skills, motivation, and em-
powerment (Den Hartog, Boon, Verburg, & Croon,
2013; Gerhart, 2012; Kehoe & Wright, 2013) and so
high performance bundles usually include practices
that focus on training, rewards, and participation
(Jiang, Lepak, Hu, & Baer, 2012; Sun, Aryee, & Law,
2007). High performance practices signal an organi-
zation’s interest in making a long-term investment in
employees, motivating employees to reciprocate
with higher engagement in their work roles (Gong,
Chang, & Cheung, 2010; Sun et al., 2007).
High performance practices are identity blind
(Konrad & Linnehan, 1995); they apply to all em-
ployees, regardless of age. High performance2016
Kulik, Perera, and Cregan
practices send signals to mature-age employees that
the organization values them as individuals, affirm-
ing the mature-age employee’s personal identity.
The organization is motivated to develop their skills
and competences and is interested in their views
(Herrbach, Mignonac, Vandenberghe, & Negrini,
2009; Maurer & Rafuse, 2001); these signals will
reduce stereotype threat. In addition, we predict that
high performance practices will have an indirect ef-
fect on employee engagement. Alfes, Truss, Soane,
Rees, and Gatenby (2013) demonstrated that high
performance practices were positively associated
with employee engagement in two organizations.
Hypothesis 3a. There will be a significant asso-
ciation between high performance practices and
stereotype threat such that the lowest levels of
stereotype threat will be experienced by mature-
age workers whose organizations offer high
performance practices.
Hypothesis 4a. There will be a significant in-
direct effect of high performance practices (via
stereotype threat) such that the highest levels of
engagement will be reported by mature-age
workers whose organizations offer high perfor-
mance practices.
Because their identity group is not explicitly ac-
knowledged, employees may be skeptical of affirm-
ing messages delivered by identity blind practices
(Plaut, Garnett, Buffardi, & Sanchez-Burks, 2011;
Shih, Young, & Bucher, 2013). As a result, the
affirming messages sent by high performance prac-
tice bundles may be less effective than affirming
messages sent by identity conscious practice bun-
dles (Konrad & Linnehan, 1995) that explicitly target
mature-age workers and affirm their social identity.
Identity conscious practices deliver greater psycho-
logical safety to members of stigmatized identity
groups (Purdie-Vaughns et al., 2008). Identity con-
scious practices tell employees that “people like
them are valued and respected” (Kulik & Li, 2015:
565). The message sent by identity conscious orga-
nizational practices is unambiguous; the identity
group affirmation is visible not only to the target of
the practices (the mature-age worker) but to the
mature-age worker’s managers and co-workers
(Armstrong-Stassen & Schlosser, 2011).
Supportive mature-age practices involve for-
mally recognizing (Hennekam & Herrbach, 2013;
Shacklock et al., 2007) and celebrating (Mountford,
2013) mature-age worker achievements. Aging is as-
sociated with a rising interest in helping future
2137
generations (Kanfer & Ackerman, 2004), so mature-
age workers might experience opportunities to men-
tor and develop other people as self-affirming (Kooij,
de Lange, Jansen, & Dikkers, 2008). Placing mature-
age employees in meaningful and visible roles
(Shacklock et al., 2007), making explicit investments
in mature-age worker training (Armstrong-Stassen &
Ursel, 2009; Bal, De Jong, Jansen, & Bakker, 2012),
and strategically redesigning jobs to reduce physical
effort without a loss of their high status decision
making components (Hennekam & Herrbach, 2013;
Mountford, 2013) might all be effective strategies for
counteracting stereotype threat.
We predict that identity conscious mature-age
practices will reduce stereotype threat and cultivate
higher engagement among mature-age workers—
above and beyond the impact of identity blind high
performance practices (Armstrong, Flood, Guthrie,
Liu, MacCurtain, & Mkamwa, 2010). Compared to
younger employees, older workers express stronger
needs for seeing their skills recognized, for being
respected by co-workers and management, and for
being involved in continuing education (Armstrong-
Stassen, 2008; McEvoy & Blahna, 2001). Mature-age
practices acknowledge these needs and send clear
signals to mature-age employees that the organiza-
tion is prepared to address them (Boehm, Kunze, &
Bruch, 2014; Herrbach et al., 2009). People who
perceive more supportive conditions to express their
true selves at work, including their full array of per-
sonal and social identities, tend to be engaged and
fully invest in the work role (Kahn, 1992).
Hypothesis 3b. There will be a significant asso-
ciation between mature-age practices and ste-
reotype threat such that the lowest levels of
stereotype threat will be experienced by mature-
age workers whose organizations offer mature-
age practices.
Hypothesis 4b. There will be a significant in-
direct effect of mature-age practices on engage-
ment (via stereotype threat) such that the
highest levels of engagement will be reported
by mature-age workers whose organizations offer
mature-age practices.
Moderating Influences
To this point, we have considered only the main
effects of organizational practices. However, we also
expect that organizational practices will exhibit
an interactive effect on some threat-inducing cues,
particularly the cue delivered by a manager’s age.2138
Academy of Management Journal
Demographic cues in the organizational environ-
ment are ambiguous (Purdie-Vaughns et al., 2008;
Walton et al., 2015); they suggest, but do not confirm,
that negative stereotypes may be operating in the
organization. Employees experience a need to re-
duce uncertainty (Bowen & Ostroff 2004; Ostroff &
Bowen, 2016), so organizational policies and prac-
tices can be “critical” (Steele, 2010: 147) in helping
employees to interpret ambiguous contextual cues.
Employees perceive managers as the implemen-
ters of people management practices (Zohar, 2000;
Zohar & Luria, 2004), so they interpret specific prac-
tices as reflecting managers’ dispositional attitudes
(e.g., viewing the manager as fair or caring; Nishii et al.,
2008). Organization-level high performance work
practices and other human resource management ac-
tivities have been linked to increased trust in an orga-
nizational leader (e.g., Zacharatos, Barling, & Iverson,
2005) but there is no direct evidence that HRM practices
generate trust in team members (Fulmer & Gelfand,
2012). For example, gay and lesbian employees describe
organizational leaders as more committed to equitable
treatment when their organization has sexual diversity-
affirming practices in place (Button, 2001). Similarly,
when mature-age employees perceive that their orga-
nization values members of their age identity group,
they will assume that their manager shares those views.
Affirming organizational practices “disambiguate” the
context so that a young manager no longer generates
a sense of threat; the demographic cue is viewed as
“benign” (Purdie-Vaughns et al., 2008: 617).
Hypothesis 5a. The indirect relationship between
manager age and mature-age worker engage-
ment will be moderated by high performance
practices: The impact of manager age on en-
gagement (via stereotype threat) will be weaker
for mature-age workers whose organizations of-
fer high performance practices.
Hypothesis 5b. The indirect relationship be-
tween manager age and mature-age worker en-
gagement will be moderated by mature-age
practices: The impact of manager age on en-
gagement (via stereotype threat) will be weaker
for mature-age workers whose organizations
offer mature-age practices.
METHODS
Participants
The data used in this investigation are part of
a large national project investigating the experience
December
of mature-age workers in Australia. Mature-age (45
years or older; ABS, 2004) employees were re-
cruited using newspaper advertisements in Sydney,
Adelaide, and Melbourne. The advertisements in-
dicated that a university research team was “conducting
a research project to understand the work experi-
ences of people who are 451.” Participants com-
pleted surveys either online or in hard copy and
provided information about themselves, their jobs,
and their employers. Participants received a gift
card (AU$20) after each survey.
A total of 1000 mature-age employees responded to
our survey in Wave 1 (August–October 2011); 881 in
Wave 2 (April–June 2012) and 783 in Wave 3
(April–June 2013). We promised confidentiality but
the surveys were not anonymous so we had contact
details for each respondent. We made three attempts
to contact a respondent by email and/or phone (ide-
ally using both forms of contact) before accepting that
a case was lost to attrition. We required that re-
spondents be employed at the time of survey distri-
bution. A total of 53% of the attrition between Waves
1 and 2 and 67% of the attrition between Waves 2 and
3 is attributable to respondents who had voluntarily
or involuntarily resigned or retired. The remaining
attrition reflects respondents who declined to par-
ticipate (very rare) or who we were unable to contact.
We compared the Wave 2 and Wave 3 samples against
our starting sample (Wave 1, n 5 1000) across a wide
range of demographics and found no significant dif-
ferences. This analysis is based on 666 employees
who participated in all three waves of data collection
and worked for the same employer in all three waves.
Participants were aged between 45 and 75 (mean
53 years); 65% were male. They worked in a wide
variety of jobs and industries with 57% employed
in managerial, professional, technical and scientific
jobs, and 73% employed in manufacturing, con-
struction, and service industries. The length of time
they had spent working in their current organization
ranged from less than a year to 45 years (mean
11 years).
Contextual Predictors
Manager age. Participants reported their manager’s
age in Wave 2 in response to the question: “How old is
your immediate supervisor/manager?” Participant re-
sponses ranged from 24 to 70 years, and manager age
was treated as a continuous variable in subsequent
analyses.
Workgroup age. In Wave 2, participants described
the age composition of their immediate workgroup2016
Kulik, Perera, and Cregan
as: (1) mostly older (older than 45 years); (2) mostly
younger (younger than 45 years); or (3) a mix of
older and younger workers (Avery et al., 2007).
We converted this categorical variable into a di-
chotomous workgroup age variable (0 5 mostly
older or a mix; 1 5 mostly younger).
Occupation. Participants selected their occupa-
tion group in Wave 2 from five options: (1) manage-
rial, professional, technical and scientific, (2)
clerical and secretarial, (3) sales and personal ser-
vice, (4) craft and skilled manual, and (5) semi-
skilled and unskilled manual. These options reflect
the major occupational groups in the Australian and
New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupa-
tions (ABS, 2013). In the Australian context, “craft
and skilled manual” occupations require training
and credentialing (e.g., via an apprenticeship); the
roles have both physical and cognitive components.
Both semi-skilled and unskilled manual occupations
are categorized as manual laborers in international
classification systems (Erikson & Goldthorpe, 1992;
Ganzeboom, De Graaf, & Tremain, 1992). Laborers
“perform a variety of routine and repetitive physical
tasks using hand and power tools and machines”
(ABS, 2009); these occupations involve physical
work requiring no formal cognitive training. We
converted the categorical responses into a di-
chotomous occupation variable (0 5 managerial,
clerical, sales or craft/skilled manual; 1 5 semi-
skilled and unskilled manual).
High performance practices. High performance
practice bundles include employee training, re-
wards and participation (Jiang et al., 2012; Sun et al.,
2007). Based on the literature (e.g., Datta, Guthrie, &
Wright, 2005; Wright, Gardner, Moynihan, & Allen,
2005) we included eight items in Wave 2 asking the
extent to which high performance practices were
available at the respondent’s workplace (1 5 not at
all; 5 5 a very large extent); Cronbach’s a 5 .86. The
items addressed training, promotion, and participa-
tion practices; the full set of items appears in the
Appendix.
Mature-age practices. Based on the literature (e.g.,
Armstrong-Stassen & Schlosser, 2011; Armstrong-
Stassen & Templer, 2006; Crowne, Cochran, &
Carpenter, 2014), we developed eight items for
Wave 1 that assessed the extent to which supportive
mature-age practices were available at the re-
spondent’s workplace (1 5 not at all; 5 5 a very large
extent); Cronbach’s a 5 .87. The items addressed
age-specific training, mentoring and career man-
agement practices; the full set of items appears in
the Appendix.

Mediating Variable: Stereotype Threat
We measured stereotype threat in Wave 2. Roberson,
Deitch, Brief, and Block (2003) drew on Steele and
Aronson’s (1995) work in laboratory settings to de-
velop a 5-item measure of race-based stereotype threat
in the workplace. Consistent with Steele et al.’s (2002)
conceptual definition of stereotype threat, all of the
items focused on the respondent’s concerns about how
other people in the workplace might see them (Shapiro
& Neuberg, 2007). We modified the Roberson et al.
(2003) items to focus on age (e.g., “Some people in my
workplace feel I have less ability because of my age”).
Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1 5
strongly disagree to 5 5 strongly agree and we averaged
the items to create an overall stereotype threat score;
Cronbach’s a 5 .82.
Outcome Variable: Engagement
We measured engagement in Wave 3 using seven
items from the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale
(Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). Sample items include “At
my work, I feel bursting with energy” (vigor) and “I
am enthusiastic about my job” (dedication). Partici-
pants responded on a scale ranging from 1 5 strongly
disagree to 5 5 strongly agree. The vigor and dedi-
cation dimensions are highly inter-correlated, and
following advice from previous research (Balducci,
Fraccaroli, & Schaufeli, 2010; Schaufeli, Bakker, &
Salanova, 2006), we averaged the items to create
an overall engagement score; Cronbach’s a 5 .89.
Control Variables
Engagement is associated with employee age (Pitt-
Catsouphes & Matz-Costa, 2008; Schaufeli et al.,
2006), gender (Gallup, 2013; Schaufeli et al., 2006),
and education and tenure (Gallup, 2013). The impact
of high performance work practices can differ as
a function of employee age and tenure (Macky &
Boxall, 2008). Therefore, we included several Wave
2 individual-level control variables: employee age
(continuous: 45–75 years); gender (male 5 1; female 5 0);
education (university degree 5 1; other 5 0); and
organizational tenure (continuous: .20–45 years).
Workgroup size may affect the impact of both di-
versity cues and organizational practices (Boehm,
Dwertmann, Kunze, Michaelis, Parks, & McDonald,
2014), and high performance work practices have
differing impact across industries (Datta et al., 2005;
Murphy & Williams, 2010). Therefore we included
workgroup size (2–212 employees) and industryDecember

We first assessed the discriminant validity of the
multi-item measures reported by the research partici-
pants. We used AMOS (Arbuckle, 1997) to conduct
a confirmatory factor analysis with four latent variables
representing high performance practices, mature-age
practices, stereotype threat and engagement. This gen-
erated x 2 5 1211.44 (df 5 344), p , .001. The fit indices
showed a good fit to the data (comparative fit index
(CFI) 5 .90; incremental fit index (IFI) 5 .90; root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA) 5 .06). CFI
and IFI values that are closer to 1 reflect better-fitting
models (Byrne, 2001) and values of .08 or less for
RMSEA indicate good fit (Dilalla, 2000). We compared
the four-factor model against a three-factor one (with
a single latent variable representing both practice
bundles). The three-factor model generated x 2 (df 5
347) 5 2538.07, p , .001 (CFI 5 .74; IFI 5 .74; RMSEA 5
.10), with significantly poorer fit than the four-factor
model: Dx 2 (df 5 3) 5 1326.63, p , .001.
Means, standard deviations and inter-correlations
are reported in Table 1. We began our hypothesis testing
using hierarchical multiple regression. The continuous
variables involved in interactions (manager age, high
performance practices and mature-age practices) were
centered before analysis (Aiken & West, 1991).
Table 2 (Step 1) presents the results of a regression
equation predicting stereotype threat. Confirming
Hypothesis 1a, the younger the manager, the higher
the level of stereotype threat (b 5 2.01, p , .01).
Confirming Hypotheses 1b and 1c, respondents re-
ported higher levels of stereotype threat when they
were part of a young workgroup (b 5 .34, p , .01)
and worked in an unskilled manual occupation
(b 5 .28, p , .05). Confirming Hypotheses 3a and 3b,
the effects of both practice bundles were also significant.
Respondents reported lower levels of stereotype threat
when their organization made greater investment in
high performance practices (b 5 2.11, p , .01) and
mature-age practices (b 5 2.21, p , .01).
RESULTS
(manufacturing 5 1; other 5 0) as control variables.
Finally, we also included a 3-item career encour-
agement measure (sample item 5 “To what extent
has a person more senior in position than yourself
encouraged you in your career development?”;
Cronbach’s a 5 .83) (South, Markham, Bonjean, &
Corder, 1987; Tharenou, Latimer, & Conroy, 1994)
because mature-age workers often receive less sup-
port for training and development than younger
workers (Martin, Dymock, Billett, & Johnson, 2014;
National Seniors Productive Ageing Centre, 2011).

We complemented our regression analysis with
a Relative Weight Analysis (RWA) using RWA-Web
(Tonidandel & LeBreton, 2015). RWA decomposes
the total variance predicted in a regression model
(i.e., the model’s R 2 ) into weights reflecting the pro-
portional contribution of the predictor variables.
Therefore, the relative weights can be interpreted as
estimates of the predictors’ relative effect sizes; they
are particularly useful in identifying which pre-
dictors are explaining non-trivial variance in an
outcome (even in the presence of additional, corre-
lated predictors) (Tonidandel & LeBreton, 2015).
Significance levels of relative weights are based on
bootstrapping procedures with 95% bias-corrected
and accelerated confidence intervals (CIs) using
10,000 replications (Tonidandel & LeBreton, 2011).
Table 3 reports the rank-ordered weights associated
with our contextual predictors along with their CIs
and proportional contributions to the explained
variance in stereotype threat. The sum of the relative
weights (RWs) (across all predictor variables in the
equation, including controls) equals the model’s R 2

(Table 2, Step 1 R 2 5 .19); we present results only for
the predictors associated with our hypotheses. All
five of the contextual variables exhibit significant
RWs (i.e., their CIs do not include zero).
The relative weights can be compared to learn
whether particular predictors are significantly more
important than others. A comparative analysis of the
weights associated with our contextual variables
demonstrated the following. First, workgroup age
explains significantly more variance in stereotype
threat than either manager age or occupation. Second,
there is no significant difference in the variance
explained by the two practice bundles (high perfor-
mance practices and mature-age practices). Third,
there is no significant difference between the variance
explained by high performance practices and work-
group age, manager age, or occupation; however,
mature-age practices explains significantly greater
variance than either manager age or occupation.
Table 4 (Step 1) presents the results of a regression
equation predicting engagement. Stereotype threat
was negatively associated with engagement (b 5
2.13, p , .01). Respondents reported higher levels of
engagement when their organizations offered high
performance practices (b 5 .07, p , .05) and mature-
age practices (b 5 .18, p , .01). Table 5 reports the
RWA results: rank-ordered weights along with their
CIs and proportional contributions to the explained
variance in engagement. The weights associated
with stereotype threat, mature-age practices and
high performance practices were all significant, and
there were no significant differences among them.
Neither the regression coefficients, nor the relative
weights, associated with manager age, workgroup
age, or occupation were significant. However, this
does not rule out the possibility that these contextual

variables have significant indirect effects on engage-
ment via stereotype threat: nonsignificant regression
coefficients indicate only that the predictors (threat-
inducing cues) do not affect the outcome (engage-
ment) independent of the mediator’s (stereotype
threat) effect (Hayes, 2013: 101).
We used the PROCESS macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2013;
Preacher, Rucker, & Hayes, 2007) and bias-corrected
bootstrapping to test the mediational hypotheses
expressed in Hypotheses 2a–c and 4a–b. These results
are presented in Table 6. Confirming the hypotheses,
all five contextual cues significantly affected mature-
age worker engagement via stereotype threat (i.e., the
confidence intervals do not contain zero).
Finally, we investigated moderation of the indirect
effects, as expressed in Hypotheses 5a (high perfor-
mance practices) and 5b (mature-age practices).
We constructed interaction terms and investigated
their impact on stereotype threat (the mediator) and
engagement (the outcome). Step 2 in Table 2 displays
a moderating effect on stereotype threat: manager age
x mature-age practices (b 5 .01, p , .01). In our

documents the effect of manager age at low levels of
mature-age practices (1.24, one standard deviation
below the mean) and high levels of mature-age

interaction on engagement; results are reported in
Table 6. Supporting Hypothesis 5b, the PROCESS
results indicated a significant indirect effect of the
manager age x mature-age practices interaction:
Young managers generate lower engagement among
mature-age workers (via higher levels of stereotype
threat) in contexts with low levels of mature-age
practices; the effect of manager age is nonsignificant
at high levels of mature-age practices.
Disconfirming Hypothesis 5a, there was no evi-
dence that high performance practices moderated
the effect of manager age on stereotype threat
(Table 2, Step 2: b 5 .00, p 5 n.s.). But high perfor-
mance practices did moderate the direct effect of
manager age on engagement (Table 4, Step 2: b 5 .01,
p , .05). Figure 3 documents the effect of manager
age at low levels of high performance practices (2.05,
one standard deviation below the mean) and high
levels of high performance practices (3.81, one
standard deviation above the mean). Older managers
generate lower levels of engagement in contexts with
low levels of high performance practices (b 5 2.01,
p , .05) but not in contexts with high levels of high
performance practices (b 5 .00, p 5 n.s.).
In additional analyses, we considered the possi-
bility that the two practice bundles might: (a) interact
with one another and/or (b) interact with workgroup
age and occupation to influence stereotype threat
and/or engagement. These non-hypothesized in-
teractions were not significant in either analysis.
Further, including these non-hypothesized in-
teractions did not change the significance of the in-
teractions reported here: The effect of manager age
on stereotype threat is moderated by mature-age

practices and the effect of manager age on engage-
ment is moderated by high performance practices.
DISCUSSION
We adopted a stereotype threat framework to study
mature-age worker engagement and found that
mature-age workers who experienced stereotype
threat in the workplace reported lower levels of en-
gagement 11–12 months later. This finding is con-
sistent with theory suggesting that stereotype threat
can lead to psychological disengagement from the
performance domain (Steele & Aronson, 1995; Steele
et al., 2002). On a practical level, our research iden-
tified an important (but hidden) antecedent of
mature-age worker disengagement that can be
addressed by organizational practices.
We investigated three threat-inducing contextual
cues: young manager, young workgroup, and manual
occupation. All three cues significantly affected
stereotype threat and indirectly affected engagement
(via stereotype threat). We also investigated threat-
inhibiting cues in the form of two distinct “bundles”
of organizational practices. Both an identity blind
high performance practice bundle and an identity
conscious mature-age practice bundle were associ-
ated with lower stereotype threat. Further, both
bundles generated higher engagement among mature-
age workers by reducing stereotype threat.
We found that organizational practices moderated the
relationship between manager age and engagement, but
this moderating effect operated differently for the two
practice bundles. Mature-age practices moderated the
indirect effect of manager age. As predicted, the highest
levels of stereotype threat (and the lowest levels of en-
gagement) were experienced by mature-age workers
with young managers in workplaces that had low levels
of supportive mature-age practices. This finding is
consistent with the stereotype threat framework, and
suggests that organizations can counter negative
demographic cues in the employee’s local work
environment by adopting practices that affirm
mature-age worker group identity.
In contrast, high performance practices moderated the
direct (non-mediated) effect of manager age; without
high performance practices in place, older managers
generated less engagement than younger ones. This
finding is not predicted by the stereotype threat frame-
work, but it might reflect the experience (and comfort
level) that managers of different ages have with the
management practices inherent in high performance
work systems. Young line managers may spontaneously
empower their employees and encourage participation
December
even in the absence of formal high performance practices
(Yanadori & van Jaarsveld, 2014). Educational changes
have encouraged later generations of leaders to be less
prescriptive, more group-focused and more organic
than previous ones (Gilbert, Collins, & Brenner,
1990), and these perspectives may motivate young
managers to empower subordinates and seek their
input even when their workplace does not have for-
mal high performance work practices in place.
Aging Workforce as a Grand Challenge
The aging of the world’s population is “one of the
main problems of this century” (International Labour
Organization, 2009). It affects, or will affect, both de-
veloped and developing countries (United Nations,
Department of Economic and Social Affairs,
Population Division, 2015). Maintaining employ-
ment of mature-age workers beyond traditional re-
tirement ages is widely seen as an important part of
the solution (Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development [OECD], 2006). But employers have
been slow to respond to this grand challenge. In
Australia, 44% of employers are unprepared for the
impact of an ageing workforce (Chandler Macleod,
2013). The Society for Human Resource Management
(SHRM) reaches a similarly pessimistic conclusion
about U.S. employers: only 36% of the HR pro-
fessionals SHRM surveyed had examined their poli-
cies and practices in light of an aging workforce
(Gurchiek, 2015). These statistics suggest that orga-
nizations may be blindsided by this grand challenge.
Eventually, organizations will look to the manage-
ment research literature for advice and tools.
Policies designed to keep mature-age people working
longer should first focus management researchers’ at-
tention on the high end of the mature-age continuum,
and motivate us to identify strategies for keeping em-
ployees engaged in their work as they near, and pass,
traditional retirement ages. Unfortunately, management
research has historically focused more on the negative
workplace factors that motivate older workers to exit
than on the positive workplace factors that encourage
older worker retention and engagement (Armstrong-
Stassen & Schlosser, 2011). Management researchers
also need to attend to the low end of the mature-age
continuum. Societal efforts to develop policy and
enact legislation around mature-age workers are
creating an explicit identity group and simulta-
neously stigmatizing that group’s members by re-
peatedly exposing negative employer attitudes
(Desmette & Gaillard, 2008). The public perception
of a mature-age worker “is getting younger. . .in2016
Kulik, Perera, and Cregan
five-yearly increments. . .forget 65 think 50 or even
45” (Brice, 2016). Our research definitions of the
“mature-age” worker will need updating if we are to
fully understand the impact of social policy.
Further, this grand challenge cannot be fully
addressed if management researchers rely on tradi-
tional research frameworks. Previous research on
mature-age workers has emphasized two primary
perspectives (Perry, Dokko, & Golom, 2012). One
perspective, the discrimination and fairness per-
spective, focuses on age stereotypes’ influence on
employer decisions (Perry, 1997). This perspective
has spawned training initiatives that encourage
decision-makers to recognize and suppress their
stereotypes; initiatives that have had limited success
(Kulik & Roberson, 2008) and unintended conse-
quences (Kulik, Perry, & Bourhis, 2000). The other
perspective, the relational demography perspective
(Tsui & Gutek, 1999; Tsui & O’Reilly, 1989), predicts
that both older and younger workers will display more
positive employee attitudes in work environments
composed of similar-aged coworkers. But researchers
have demonstrated asymmetrical effects for older and
younger workers (e.g., Chattopadhyay, 1999) and
concluded that “similarity alone may be insufficient
for. . .engagement” (Avery et al., 2007: 1544).
The stereotype threat framework may help man-
agement researchers to identify a “fresh portfolio of
strategies that organizations can use to attract, mo-
tivate, and retain older workers” (Kulik, 2014a: 460).
Organizations are naturally “saturated” (Purdie-
Vaughns et al., 2008: 628) with cues that might in-
duce stereotype threat. For example, mature-age
employees can find themselves in significantly
younger workgroups or supervised by significantly
younger managers as a function of organizational
restructurings. But even benign cues can generate
stereotype threat among mature-age employees, and
reduce their engagement. The unique value of the
stereotype threat framework is that it highlights
contextual cues as inducing and inhibiting stereo-
type threat; i.e., the workplace context may generate
both the problem and the solution (Kulik, 2014a).
We encourage management researchers to view this
grand challenge as an unprecedented opportunity to
impact managerial practice and design organiza-
tional contexts that successfully engage a large—and
growing—segment of the workforce.
Theoretical Contributions
This research makes two distinct contributions to
the management literature. First, the research makes
2145
a contribution to the small but growing literature on
stereotype threat in the workplace. Stereotype threat
has received a great deal of research attention, but the
empirical database has focused on a limited range of
participants (emphasizing college students) and
outcomes (emphasizing academic performance and
performance on laboratory tasks) (Block et al., 2011;
von Hippel, Issa, Ma, & Stokes, 2011; von Hippel
et al., 2013). In an extensive meta-analysis summa-
rizing the effect of stereotype threat on the perfor-
mance of women and racial minorities, Nguyen and
Ryan (2008) report an overall effect size of d 5 .26;
focusing specifically on the effect of age-related
threat on performance, Lamont et al. (2015) report
d 5 .28. Responding to these “robust” (Spencer et al.,
2015: 14.4) effects of acute stereotype threat, some
authors have highlighted a “pressing need” to study
the outcomes of chronic stereotype threat
(Woodcock et al., 2012: 644). However, the “moder-
ate to small” (Spencer et al., 2015: 14.4) size of acute
stereotype threat effects in the laboratory has led
other authors to speculate that chronic stereotype
threat effects “would be difficult to isolate” in orga-
nizational contexts, so stereotype threat has “limited
usefulness” to organizational researchers (Streets &
Major, 2014: 447). In fact, the correlation we ob-
served between stereotype threat and engagement
(r 5 .26) converts to d 5 .54, a medium effect size
(Cohen, 1988); even a conservative semi-partial
correlation (r 5 .13) controlling for other individual
and organizational effects on engagement (Table 4)
converts to d 5 .26 and compares well with effects
observed in the laboratory. Further, stereotype threat
effects in organizations may have a ripple effect. The
persistent extra pressure experienced by members of
stereotyped groups in high-threat environments may
eventually undermine their sense of well-being and
happiness and even contribute to physical health
problems (Steele, 2010: 127). Stereotype threat has
been associated with inflammation processes (John-
Henderson, Rheinschmidt, Mendoza-Denton, &
Francis, 2014) that are implicated in several chronic
diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
and depression.
Second, this research makes a contribution to the
literature focusing on diversity management. Re-
searchers frequently highlight the challenges of
a diverse workforce, emphasizing that managerial
practices can make the difference in whether di-
versity benefits or disrupts organizational perfor-
mance (Jehn & Bezrukova, 2004; Kulik & Roberson,
2008). But there has been considerable debate about
whether organizations are best served by an identity2146
Academy of Management Journal
blind or an identity conscious approach to diversity
management. Some authors have argued that an
identity conscious strategy will produce better, more
sustainable, long-range outcomes than an identity
blind one (Ely & Thomas, 2001); others have argued
for equifinality, suggesting that either diversity
management approach will be effective as long as it is
consistent with the organization’s culture (Thomas &
Gabarro, 1999). Unfortunately, there is very little
research contrasting “plain vanilla people manage-
ment” practices against practices that focus on par-
ticular demographic groups (Kulik, 2014b: 136). Our
research suggests that the identity blind and identity
conscious practice bundles operate independently
and additively to influence mature-age worker en-
gagement. Derks et al. (2007) use the term “double
valuation” to describe the value of having one’s in-
dividual and group identity simultaneously affirmed
by an organization; our results demonstrate the
“double valuation” effect the practice bundles can
have on engagement.
Practical Contributions
Practitioners recognize the value of employee en-
gagement as an antecedent of employee performance
and organizational productivity (Christian et al.,
2011; Ho et al., 2011). A fully engaged employee
delivers the full value of his or her salary; a dis-
engaged or semi-engaged employee might deliver
only 60–80% (Jones, 2012). Other sources suggest
that an organization loses $3,400 for every $10,000
of a disengaged employee’s salary (Coffman &
Gonzalez-Molina, 2002; Haydon, 2013). The aver-
age salary in Australia in 2014 was nearly AU
$80,000 (Ma, 2014), so a single disengaged employee
could cost his or her employer AU$16,000–32,000
each year. However, the cost of disengagement may
be even higher for a mature-age employee, whose
years of experience are likely to place him or her at
the high end of organizational pay scales.
Our research demonstrates that stereotype threat is
significantly related to engagement. Therefore,
managers concerned about engaging their mature-
age workers first need to recognize the cues that in-
duce stereotype threat. Young managers, young
workgroups, and manual occupations all generate
stereotype threat. The RWA demonstrates that all
three of these contextual variables (manager age,
workgroup age composition, and occupation) ac-
count for significant variance in stereotype threat,
but workgroup age composition accounts for the
largest share. Colleagues’ ages are visible to a mature-
December
age employee throughout the workday, so ongoing
interactions with young coworkers are likely to
repeatedly activate age-related stereotype threat
(Kalokerinos et al., 2014). Trying to eliminate all
threat-inducing cues from the work environment is
a “futile exercise” (Davies et al., 2005: 278). An un-
skilled manual occupation cannot easily be trans-
formed into a professional one and equal opportunity
regulations constrain a manager’s ability to use age as
a criterion in workgroup or supervisory assignments.
Still, managers can and should be aware of the risks
associated with threat-inducing cues in their local
work contexts. For example, young and expanding
firms tend to employ lower proportions of older
workers than older, well-established firms (Schøne,
2009), so managers in recently-established firms
might need to be especially vigilant about avoiding
age-discriminatory hiring practices and actively re-
cruit mature-age workers.
Further, managers can adopt practices that deliver
identity-affirming cues to mature-age workers and
inhibit stereotype threat. In our research, both high
performance and mature-age practices were associ-
ated with lower stereotype threat. Our RWA showed
no statistically significant difference in the contribu-
tions made by the two practice bundles. But only
mature-age practices (not high performance practices)
exhibited a significantly higher weight than manager
age and occupation. And only mature-age practices
interacted with manager age to counteract the negative
cues sent by young managers. In general, therefore,
mature-age practices were more effective than high
performance practices in reducing stereotype threat.
Our hypotheses focused on the indirect effects of
the practice bundles on engagement via stereotype
threat, but the results demonstrated that both high
performance practices and mature-age practices
also have direct effects on engagement. High per-
formance practices were particularly beneficial in
maintaining engagement among mature-age workers
with managers at the older end of the age continuum.
Both practice bundles influence engagement di-
rectly and indirectly, but mature-age practices are
more effective through an indirect pathway (via ste-
reotype threat) and high performance practices are
more effective through a direct pathway (direct ef-
fects on engagement). Our findings demonstrate that
there is considerable value in adopting management
practices that engage mature-age workers, a large and
growing proportion of the workforce in many coun-
tries. Over four million people in the Australian la-
bor force are aged 45 years or older (ABS, 2010);
mature-age workers account for about 40% of the2016
Kulik, Perera, and Cregan
total Australian workforce (Busyatwork, 2015).
Even small effects have “enormous” implications
when they affect large numbers of people (Aguinis,
2004: 143).
Given our evidence that high performance prac-
tices and mature-age practices both deliver benefits,
organizations should consider adopting both types
of practices. Rather than viewing identity blind and
identity conscious practices as an either/or choice (a
“fork in the road,” Kulik & Li, 2015), organizations
might instead think of identity conscious practice
bundles as supplementing their diversity blind
practice portfolio. Firms that invest heavily in
training and participation (part of the high perfor-
mance bundle) may be more likely to become aware
of, and motivated to address, the needs of particular
demographic groups. We demonstrated that identity
blind and identity conscious practices have in-
dependent effects on individual-level outcomes
(engagement) but these practice bundles may also
have independent effects at other levels of analysis.
Armstrong et al. (2010) found that organizations
offering identity conscious diversity practices
benefited from higher labor productivity and work-
place innovation, and lower voluntary employee
turnover—these benefits were above and beyond the
effects of traditional high performance practices.
Unfortunately, identity conscious practices are
not common. Armstrong-Stassen and Cattaneo
(2010) report that Canadian organizations have few
practices in place to address older workers’ needs
and preferences and our own data demonstrated that
identity conscious mature-age practices were less
common than identity blind high performance ones.
Further, identity conscious practices may be viewed
as discretionary, jettisoned when organizational re-
sources and budgets are slashed. Armstrong-Stassen
and Cattaneo (2010) found that organizations that
had downsized were significantly less likely to have
human resource practices tailored to the needs of
older workers and had a less supportive training and
development climate for older workers. In the ab-
sence of formal practices, important issues may go
unaddressed, because managers do not spontane-
ously take responsibility for age issues in the work-
place (Furunes, Mykletun, & Solem, 2011).
Limitations and Future Research Directions
In this research, we were able to enlist the help of
a large and diverse sample of mature-age workers.
We asked the employees to report on both the prac-
tices operating in their organizations and on their
2147
psychological experiences. Self-report is unavoid-
able for measures of stereotype threat, because only
employees can report on their own psychological
states (Chan, 2009). Employees and managers are
both able to report on workplace practices, but these
two parties can disagree on the practices operating
in their own organizations (Nishii & Wright, 2008).
Therefore, some researchers have urged for more
attention to be given to employee reports of practices
(Nishii et al., 2008); employee perceptions “matter
more” than manager perceptions because they are
more closely linked to employee experience (Den
Hartog et al., 2013: 1642). However, future research
should replicate our findings using manager and
employee reports of organizational practices. Multi-
source research would provide greater confidence
that the high performance and mature-age practices
adopted by organizations are interpreted by em-
ployees as affirming signals, so that the practices
have their intended effects (Nishii et al., 2008;
Takeuchi et al., 2009).
Our research contrasted the effects of identity blind
high performance practices and identity conscious
mature-age practices. The items included in our mature-
age practices “bundle” were drawn from the literature
(e.g., Armstrong-Stassen & Schlosser, 2011; Armstrong-
Stassen & Templer, 2006; Crowne et al., 2014) and
loaded cleanly onto a single underlying factor. How-
ever, other researchers have suggested that mature-age
practices might be appropriately grouped into several
distinct sub-categories: development (e.g., training);
accommodation (e.g., flexible schedules); and exit
routes (part-time employment) (Herrbach et al., 2009;
Kooij, Jansen, Dikkers, & de Lange, 2014; van Dalen,
Henkens, & Wang, 2014). These practice bundles reflect
different organizational strategies to managing mature-
age workers (e.g., upskilling for retention or encourag-
ing early partial or complete exits) and they may appeal
to mature-age workers at different chronological ages,
career stages, and organizational levels (Kooij, Guest,
Clinton, Knight, Jansen, & Dikkers, 2013). Further,
some practice bundles (in particular, accommodation
in the form of flexible schedules or job redesign)
may unintentionally stigmatize mature-age workers
as having unique needs because of declining skills
and performance (Herrbach et al., 2009). We encour-
age researchers to consider a wide range of organi-
zational practices and their impact on mature-age
practices.
We focused specifically on organization level
practices as threat-inhibiting cues. However, there
may be other organizational sources that provide
mature-age workers with a sense of psychological2148
December
Academy of Management Journal
safety and security. Our research suggests that line
managers impact stereotype threat passively, as
a result of the inadvertent signals sent by their own
demographic characteristics. Line managers may
also actively inhibit stereotype threat, because some
(not all) line managers offer mature-age workers so-
cial support and access to tangible resources (Leisink
& Knies, 2011). But the extent to which line managers
provide this support is dependent on the manager’s
abilities and motivation (Leisink & Knies, 2011), so
it will be difficult for an organization to maintain
mature-age worker engagement across changes in
supervision. Viewed through a stereotype threat
lens, relying on line managers to reduce stereotype
threat is a well-intentioned but risky recommenda-
tion. It is not only members of low-status or disad-
vantaged identity groups who experience stereotype
threat; anyone can experience stereotype threat if
they become aware of negative stereotypes about
their identity group (Frantz, Cuddy, Burnett, Ray, &
Hart, 2004; Roberson & Kulik, 2007). Warning
a young manager about how he or she might be per-
ceived by mature-age subordinates, and encouraging
that manager to actively affirm their mature-age
subordinates, could ironically evoke stereotype
threat in the manager. Therefore, future research
should directly compare the relative effectiveness of
organization-level and dyad-level strategies for re-
ducing stereotype threat among mature-age workers.
Our mature-age workers responded to three sur-
veys over a three-year period. This design gives us
confidence that the organizational practices mea-
sured in Waves 1 and 2 contributed to the mature-age
workers’ engagement measured 1–2 years later.
Temporal separation of predictors and outcomes
reduces concerns about common method variance
associated with single-source data and attitude–
attitude relationships (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &
Podsakoff, 2003). Unfortunately, limitations on sur-
vey length meant that high performance practices
and stereotype threat had to be measured in the same
wave (Wave 2). Common method variance might
have contributed to observed associations between
the high performance practice bundle and stereotype
threat, although it is unlikely to have had an impact
on the practice x manager age interaction effects
(Siemsen, Roth, & Oliveira, 2010). We encourage
future research to adopt a longitudinal perspective
that goes beyond temporal separation to measure
practices, stereotype threat, and engagement
multiple times. This would give us a better un-
derstanding of how the impact of organizational
practices on stereotype threat, and engagement,
might accumulate (or fade) over time (Biggs, Brough,
& Barbour, 2014; Kulik, 2014b). Research suggests
that employee reports of engagement are stable over
two years (Mauno et al., 2007), and so it is important
to learn how susceptible engagement levels might be
to changes in organizational practices. Our study
also relied on perceptual measures of manager age
and workgroup age composition. These measures
align well with stereotype threat theory, because
threat is aroused by the mature-age employees’ per-
ception and interpretation of contextual cues (Steele,
2010). However, we nonetheless encourage future
research to gather objective information on work-
group age composition and manager age from com-
pany records, in order to investigate their impact on
stereotype threat (Avery et al., 2007). A continuous
measure of workgroup age composition might enable
researchers to identify compositional “tipping
points” at which a workgroup is most likely to evoke
stereotype threat in a mature-age worker.
Finally, we focused on engagement in our research.
We chose this outcome because policy changes
impacting the “working age” will keep mature-age
people in the workplace longer. Mature-age people
today are experiencing improved health and ex-
tended longevity, but less access to retirement
funding—they must continue working (Shultz &
Wang, 2011). They have fewer options to change
jobs, so they are more likely to continue working even
in a dissatisfying environment (Gringart et al., 2013;
Shacklock et al., 2007). Eventually, however, the
disidentification evoked by stereotype threat might
generate physical disengagement in the form of ab-
senteeism or exit (Block et al., 2011; Kalokerinos et al.,
2014). Future research should investigate these be-
havioral indicators of disengagement along with other
outcomes predicted by a stereotype threat framework.
For example, stereotype threat should lower work
performance, and this might be visible in the perfor-
mance appraisals received by mature-age workers.
The psychological stress associated with stereotype
threat might have an impact on health outcomes,
particularly depression and other mental outcomes,
among mature-age workers (Jackson, 2013).
